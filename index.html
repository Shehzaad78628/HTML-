        <p>During quarantine I spent my time, working out, reading books, and playing video games. I remember I was so bored that I decided to re-read the entire Harry Potter series in one sitting. Which failed, I re-read the first book and decided to just watch the movies again. I also used to workout for at least an hour everyday after I was done atttending virtual school.
